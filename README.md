# TCAD-Voter-analysis
Takes the voter registration database from here: https://tax-office.traviscountytx.gov/voter-data

Then runs some analysis stuff on the CSV. Creating a repo here to show my working.

sample.csv is a 1000 line sampling of the original TCAD file which contains roughly 650,000 registered voters.
